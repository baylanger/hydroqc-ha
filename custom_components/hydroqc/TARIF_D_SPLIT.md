# PR3 — Tarif D Low/High Price Split for Energy Dashboard

## Overview

Hydro-Québec Tarif D (and D+CPC / DCPC) charges two different rates for
electricity consumption:

- **Low price (bas prix / reg):** The first `40 kWh × billing_period_days`
  consumed during a billing period. For a typical 62-day billing period this
  is 2,480 kWh.
- **High price (haut prix / haut):** Any consumption beyond that threshold.

This PR adds two-color energy dashboard support for Tarif D / Tarif D with CPC (DCPC) rates,
mirroring the existing behavior of Tarif DT/DPC (bi-énergie) where the
Hydro-Québec API already provides separate reg/haut streams.

The 40 kWh/day threshold is defined by the constant
`TARIF_D_THRESHOLD_KWH_PER_DAY = 40` in `const.py`. If Hydro-Québec ever
changes this threshold, only that constant needs to be updated.

---

## How the split works

### Split logic

For each billing period:

1. The threshold is calculated: `40 kWh × billing_period_days`
2. Hourly consumption is processed chronologically from the start of the period
3. Each hour's consumption is assigned to:
   - **reg (low price):** `min(hour_kwh, remaining_threshold)`
   - **haut (high price):** `max(0, hour_kwh - remaining_threshold)`
4. The remaining threshold decreases as reg consumption accumulates
5. Once the threshold is exhausted, all subsequent consumption goes to haut
6. The threshold resets to 0 at the start of each new billing period

### Billing period boundaries

The split needs to know when each billing period starts and ends. Sources
used in order of preference:

1. **Recorder history of the configured billing duration sensor**
   (`sensor.hydro_quebec_maison_billing_period_duration`) — most accurate,
   covers the last 90 days (limited by `purge_keep_days`)
2. **Recorder history of the legacy sensor**
   (`sensor.hydroqc_maison_current_billing_period_duration`) — used as
   fallback for older data if available
3. **60-day approximation** (`TARIF_D_HISTORY_PERIOD_DAYS = 60`) — used
   for data older than what the recorder has. Periods are estimated by
   working backwards from the oldest known period boundary. Since actual
   periods are typically 57-64 days, the approximation error is small.

### Statistic IDs

The split writes to these statistic IDs (same as DT/DPC for consistency):

- `hydroqc:maison_reg_hourly_consumption` — Low Price Hourly Consumption
- `hydroqc:maison_haut_hourly_consumption` — High Price Hourly Consumption
- `hydroqc:maison_hourly_consumption` — Total Hourly Consumption (unchanged)

The `total` stream is **never modified** — it always remains as a rollback
safety net.

## New features

### 1. Energy dashboard split (Tarif D and Tarif D with CPC / DCPC only)

Dark blue = low price, light blue = high price in the HA energy dashboard.

### 2. Three new sensors (Tarif D and Tarif D with CPC / DCPC only)

| Entity ID | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `sensor.hydro_quebec_maison_tarif_d_low_price_threshold_kwh` | Total low-price allowance this billing period (40 × days) |
| `sensor.hydro_quebec_maison_tarif_d_low_price_remaining_kwh` | kWh remaining at low price this period |
| `sensor.hydro_quebec_maison_tarif_d_daily_low_price_budget_kwh` | Average daily low-price budget remaining |

### 3. Service: `hydroqc.resplit_tarif_d_history`

One-time service to re-split all existing total statistics into Low/High
Price streams. Run this once after installing the PR.

### 4. Options flow: billing duration entity picker

An optional `EntitySelector` in the options flow allows selecting the sensor
that tracks billing period duration. Used for accurate historical re-splitting.

## Post-install instructions

### Step 1 — Configure billing duration sensor

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Hydro-Québec → Configure**
2. In the **Billing period duration sensor** field select:
   `sensor.hydro_quebec_maison_billing_period_duration`
3. Click **Save**

> This only saves the sensor selection. It does NOT run the split.

### Step 2 — Stop the old hydroqc add-on (if still running)

**Settings → Add-ons → Hydroqc → Stop**

The old add-on writes to the same database tables. Stop it before running
the migration or resplit to avoid conflicts.

### Step 3 — Migrate data from old hydroqc add-on (optional)

If you previously used the old `hydroqc` add-on and want to bring its
historical state data into the new integration, see
**[MIGRATION_FROM_LEGACY.md](MIGRATION_FROM_LEGACY.md)** for full
instructions.

> Run this step **before** the historical re-split in Step 4. The old
> add-on's billing period duration history helps the re-split detect
> period boundaries more accurately.

If you never used the old add-on, skip this step.

### Step 4 — Run the historical re-split (one time only)

1. Go to **Developer Tools → Actions**
2. Search for `hydroqc.resplit_tarif_d_history`
3. Under **Target** select your Hydro-Québec device (e.g. `maison (DCPC)`)
4. Click **Perform Action**
5. The re-split runs in the background — check **Settings → System → Logs**:
   ```
   WARNING hydroqc: Tarif D historical re-split STARTING
   WARNING hydroqc: Tarif D historical re-split COMPLETE
   ```

**Rollback resplit:**
The `total` stream is never modified. If results look wrong:
1. Go to **Developer Tools → Statistics**
2. Delete `Maison Low Price Hourly Consumption`
3. Delete `Maison High Price Hourly Consumption`
4. Fix the issue and call `hydroqc.resplit_tarif_d_history` again

### Step 5 — Add Low/High Price streams to energy dashboard

1. Go to **Settings → Energy**
2. Under **Home Consumption** click **Add consumption**
3. Search for your contract name (e.g. `maison`) — you will see:
   - **Maison Low Price Hourly Consumption**
   - **Maison High Price Hourly Consumption**
   - `Maison Total Hourly Consumption` (existing)
4. Add both **Low Price** and **High Price**
5. Optionally remove **Total** if you only want the two-color view
6. Click **Save**

### Step 6 — Clean up (optional, after verifying)

If you ran the migration script in Step 3, drop the backup tables once
satisfied:

```bash
docker exec -it $(docker ps | grep mariadb | awk '{print $1}') \
  mariadb -u homeassistant -p<password> homeassistant -e "
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS _backup_states;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS _backup_states_meta;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS _backup_statistics_meta;
"
```
